## Introduction

Digital Image Processing is a crucial aspect of computer vision and artificial intelligence. This project explores different image processing techniques, providing code implementations and documentation for better understanding.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Answers/`: Answers of the questions.
- `Answers/Practical`: Answers of the Practical questions.
- `Answers/Theorical`: Answers of the Theorical questions.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.8)
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-image-processing-hw.git
cd digital-image-processing-hw
```

## Usage

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run the Jupyter Notebooks to explore the implementation of various image processing algorithms.

```bash
cd notebooks/
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new browser window where you can interact with the notebooks.
